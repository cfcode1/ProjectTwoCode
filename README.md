# Project Two Code

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I chose to include my Project Two code. For this project, I had to develop a bank application in C++ that shows investment estimates based on user input. It would show how a user's investment will grow over time.

### What did you do particularly well?
I feel I did particularly well with organizing the structure of the code and ensuring it functioned properly. It made to program easier to follow and understand.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code to be more secure by implementing input validation. This could ensure that only to allowed inputs can be processed, which can also help reduce errors as well.

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging was aligning and formatting the text and symbols. It took me a while to figure out the right spacing but I eventually was able to format the title correctly.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
I think getting to practice with the C++ language will be very helpful for future projects because I now have a better understanding of programming fundamentals, even if the language is different, the logic is still similar, which can help me understand future coding projects easier

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To ensure my program was readable and maintainable, I followed best coding practices by using indentation and spaces when needed to separate code. I also broke up tasks in the program into functions to make it easier to understand the program functionality. Additionally, I included comments to explain different aspects of the code and used simple but understandable variable names
